Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

// Style Points
// Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative "hello world" you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?


const greet = () => {
    let h = "h"
    let e = "e"
    let l = "l"
    let o = "o"
    let space = " "
    let w = "w"
    let r = "r"
    let d = "d"
    let i = "!"
    return h+e+l+l+o+space+w+o+r+l+d+i
  }
